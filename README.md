# Discord-Exploit (PATCHED)

### Description:
Sends 2000 emojis in one message, this ultimately lags the reader as their computer is using a lot of resources to do so.

### Usage:
To install the required package: `pip install requests`

To run the file: `py ChannelOutage.py <token> <channel id> <amount to send>`

### Credit:
[void](https://github.com/voidlsd) found out about this exploit in JS first, though I figured out how to do it myself and wrote it in Python
